I am a computational biologist interested in the structure and dynamics of proteins. I studied biochemistry at the [University of Coimbra](https://www.uc.pt/fctuc/dcv/licenciaturas/licenciatura-em-bioquimica/) and later earned my Ph.D. in the [lab of Alexandre Bonvin](www.bonvinlab.org), working on protein interactions and structural bioinformatics. After a postdoc at Stanford University with [Michael Levitt](https://med.stanford.edu/levitt.html), I joined the Protein Structure Prediction team at [Schrodinger](https://schrodinger.com/).


I am a highly collaborative scientist, having published more than 40 articles in peer-reviewed journals, which have received more than 5000 citations. My work has been funded by the Niels Stensen Fellowship, the Google Summer of Code program, and The Molecular Sciences Software Institute, among others. As a computational biologist, I spend a significant portion of my research developing software for structural biology, most of which is available under permissive open-source licenses on my Github page. Some of my most high-profile contributions include being a developer of HADDOCK, a maintainer of the Biopython project, as well as being the author and lead developer of pdb-tools.

Alongside research, I enjoy spending time building and fostering communities in computational biology. I am a certified Software Carpentry instructor, and I have taught Git, Python, and software development best practices to researchers. I have also helped organize several national and international conferences - I helped start an annual meeting for Portuguese researchers in my field, and helped create a very successful EMBO Practical Course on modeling protein interactions that has drawn hundreds of participants over several editions.
